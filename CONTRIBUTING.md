Relevant JS code is in `script.js`. 

1. Get the page to scroll to the bottom (and load all the comments) before starting the deletion process, as the script currently stops when it runs out of comments on the current page instead of scrolling and loading more comments. 

2. Make a test page identical to the Comment History page for use in testing. Would be much easier than making a bunch of new YouTube comments just to test the script.
